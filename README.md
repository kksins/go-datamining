Data mining with Go
===================

A collection of algorithms for data processing in Go.

### Recommendations
Basic implementation of recommendation algorithms in Golang.

For testing, I am using GroupLens Research's MovieLens dataset from [http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) (...Thanks guys!).  Please consult their terms of use if you wish to use this set for commercial purposes.

#### Algorithms included:
- Euclidean distance
- Pearson correlation
